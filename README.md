# PsychSwitcher
PsychSwitcher is a tool for fixing potential errors when switching between versions.


# Info 

## Dependencies

These are required to run Psych Engine without any crashes or compiling errors. Make sure you download the right version for 0.6.3 or 0.7.3.
for 0.6.3 use MSVisualStudio063.bat and for 0.7.3 use MSVisualStudio073.bat. They can both be installed so you shouldn't have any errors if you have both.

I would recommend restarting your computer after you install Visual Studio 2019 and its dependencies.

## Switchers

Make sure that you are using the correct versions. Because if you don't it could break other versions. For Psych Engine 0.6.3 use fnf063fix.bat and for Psych Engine 0.7.3 use fnf073fix.bat.
