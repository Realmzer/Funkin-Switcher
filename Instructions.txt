Haxe:

Psych Engine:

0.6.3 & 0.7.3
	
If you don't already have Haxe 4.2.5 go into Dependencies/Haxe/ then double click haxe-4.2.5-win32bit.exe if you use 32 bit or haxe-4.2.5-win64.exe to use the 64 bit Haxe installer. 
For Mac users use haxe-4.2.5-osx-installer.pkg and for Linux users read Linux-Installation.txt.
Do not reinstall Haxe 4.2.5 if you already have it unless you have issues. To check if you have Haxe go to the command prompt or the terminal you use and type 'haxe --version.'
If you have Haxe installed it should show your Haxe version.

1.0b
If you don't already have Haxe 4.3.6 go into Dependencies/Haxe/ then double click haxe-4.3.6-win32.exe if you use 32 bit or haxe-4.3.6-win64.exe to use the 64 bit Haxe installer.
For Mac users use haxe-4.3.6-osx-installer.pkg and for Linux users read Linux-Installation.txt.
Do not reinstall Haxe 4.3.6 if you already have it unless you have issues. To check if you Haxe go to the command prompt or terminal you use and type 'haxe --version.'
If you have Haxe installed it should show your Haxe version.

Friday Night Funkin':

Download Haxe from the folder, /Dependencies/Haxe/haxe-4.3.6-win64.exe/ for 64 bit or use /Dependencies/Haxe/haxe-4.3.6-win32.exe/. For Mac, install /Dependencies/Haxe/haxe-4.3.6-osx-installer.pkg/. 
For Unix look at the Linux-Installation.txt at /Dependencies/Haxe/.

Git: 

 Go to /Dependencies/Git/Windows/Git-2.46.0-64-bit.exe/ for Windows. For Unix based go to, /Dependencies/Git/Linux/ then your Linux distro.

________________
 

Visual Studio Community (Windows Only):

Psych Engine:

This is required to run Psych Engine without any crashes or compiling errors.
for all versions use MSVisualStudio.bat in the Dependencies folder.

I would recommend restarting your computer after you install Visual Studio Community and its dependencies to make sure it actually works.

Friday Night Funkin': 

A component needed is MSVC v143 VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools. You can install this by using the Visual Studio Installer.
________________

Switchers:

Psych Engine:

Make sure that you are using the correct versions. Because if you don't it could cause errors while compiling.
Your version should correspond with the folder names. 
Windows: For Psych Engine 0.6.3 use psychengine063fix.bat, for Psych Engine 0.7.3 use psychengine073fix.bat, for Psych Engine 1.0b use psychengine10bfix.bat and, for Psych Engine 1.0 use psychengine10fix.bat.
Unix (Mac and Linux): For Psych Engine 0.6.3 use psychengine063fix.sh, for Psych Engine 0.7.3 use psychengine073fix.sh and for Psych Engine 1.0b use psychengine10fix.sh and, for Psych Engine 1.0 use psychengine10fix.sh.

Friday Night Funkin':

Go into the Switchers folder then, go into the Funkin folder and click your version then open a new terminal into the folder and install the hmm.json by doing this, 'hmm install'
