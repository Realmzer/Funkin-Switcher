If you don't already have Haxe 4.2.5 go into Dependencies/Haxe/ then double click haxe-4.2.5-win32bit.exe if you use 32 bit or haxe-4.2.5-win64.exe to use the 64 bit Haxe installer. 
For Mac users use haxe-4.2.5-osx-installer.pkg and for Linux users read Linux-Installation.txt.
Do not reinstall Haxe 4.2.5 if you already have it unless you have issues. To check if you have Haxe go to the command prompt or the terminal you use and type 'haxe --version.'
If you have Haxe installed it should show your Haxe version.

Visual Studio Community (Windows Only):

Psych Engine:

These are required to run Psych Engine without any crashes or compiling errors.
for all versions use MSVisualStudio.bat in the Dependencies folder.

I would recommend restarting your computer after you install Visual Studio Community and its dependencies to make sure it actually works.
