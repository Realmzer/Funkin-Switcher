Psych Switcher:

Psych Switcher is a tool for fixing potential errors when switching between versions.


 Info:

 Dependencies:
________________

 Haxe:

If you don't already have Haxe 4.2.5 go into Dependencies than choose haxe-4.2.5-win32bit.exe if you use 32 bit or haxe-4.2.5-win64.exe to use the 64 bit Haxe installer. 
For Mac users use haxe-4.2.5-osx-installer.pkg and for linux users read Linux-Installation.txt.
Do not reinstall Haxe 4.2.5 if you already have it. to check if you have haxe go to the command prompt or the terminal you use on linux and type haxe --version. 
If you have it installed it should show your haxe version.
________________

 Visual Studio Community 2019 (Windows Only):

These are required to run Psych Engine without any crashes or compiling errors. Make sure you download the right version for 0.6.3 or 0.7.3.
for 0.6.3 use MSVisualStudio063.bat and for 0.7.3 use MSVisualStudio073.bat. They can both be installed so you shouldn't have any errors if you have both.

I would recommend restarting your computer after you install Visual Studio 2019 and its dependencies.
________________

 Switchers:

Make sure that you are using the correct versions. Because if you don't it could break other versions. 
Windows: For Psych Engine 0.6.3 use fnf063fix.bat and for Psych Engine 0.7.3 use fnf073fix.bat.
Unix (Mac and Linux): For Psych Engine 0.6.3 use fnf063fix.sh and for Psych Engine 0.7.3 use fnf073fix.sh.
