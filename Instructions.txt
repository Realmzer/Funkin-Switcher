 Dependencies:
________________

 Haxe:

0.6.3 & 0.7.3
	
If you don't already have Haxe 4.2.5 go into Dependencies/Haxe/0.6.3 & 0.7.3 then double click haxe-4.2.5-win32bit.exe if you use 32 bit or haxe-4.2.5-win64.exe to use the 64 bit Haxe installer. 
For Mac users use haxe-4.2.5-osx-installer.pkg and for Linux users read Linux-Installation.txt.
Do not reinstall Haxe 4.2.5 if you already have it unless you have issues. To check if you have Haxe go to the command prompt or the terminal you use and type 'haxe --version.'
If you have Haxe installed it should show your Haxe version.

1.0b
If you don't already have Haxe 4.3.4 go into Dependencies/Haxe/1.0b then double click haxe-4.3.4-win32bit.exe if you use 32 bit or haxe-4.3.4-win64.exe to use the 64 bit Haxe installer.

________________

 Visual Studio Community (Windows Only):

These are required to run Psych Engine without any crashes or compiling errors. Make sure you download the right version for 0.6.3 or 0.7.3.
for all versions use MSVisualStudio.bat in the Dependencies folder.

I would recommend restarting your computer after you install Visual Studio Community and its dependencies.
________________

 Switchers:

Make sure that you are using the correct versions. Because if you don't it could cause errors while compiling.
Your version should correspond with the folder names. 
Windows: For Psych Engine 0.6.3 use fnf063fix.bat, for Psych Engine 0.7.3 use fnf073fix.bat and for Psych Engine 1.0b use fnf10bfix.bat.
Unix (Mac and Linux): For Psych Engine 0.6.3 use fnf063fix.sh, for Psych Engine 0.7.3 use fnf073fix.sh and for Psych Engine 1.0b use fnf10fix.sh.
